Read Me:

It was extremely difficult for me to construct the whole concept. I have tried my best to provide the partial solution.

This solution can only run if the the following steps are followed properly:-

1) compiling the c++ file at first "g++ .\3.cpp"
2) then a "a.exe" is created
3) "op.idx" you hve to create this
3) to create an index ".\a -create CS6360Asg5TestDataB.txt op.idx 4"
4) .\a -find op.idx AAAA
