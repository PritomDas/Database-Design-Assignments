Read Me:

It was extremely difficult for me to construct the whole concept. I have tried my best to provide the partial solution.

This solution can only run if the the following steps are followed properly after extracting the zipped file:-

1) compiling the c++ file at first "g++ .\3.cpp".

2) this should create a "a.exe" file.

3) "op.idx" this has to be manually created by the user on the same directory where all the above files are located. Just create a normal text file as save it as "op". Then change the extension of this file from ".txt" to ".idx" or ".indx" manually.

5) to create an index ".\a -create CS6360Asg5TestDataB.txt op.idx 4"

6) .\a -find op.idx AAAA
